"""
In a file called nutrition.py, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number
of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the FDA’s poster for fruits, which is also available as text. Capitalization aside, assume that users 
will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., strawberries, not strawberry). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit.
