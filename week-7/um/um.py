"""
It’s not uncommon, in English, at least, to say “um” when trying to, um, think of a word. The more you do it, though, the more noticeable it tends to be!

In a file called um.py, implement a function called count that expects a line of text as input as a str and returns, as an int, the number of times that “um”
appears in that text, case-insensitively, as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. For instance, given text like hello, um, world, 
the function should return 1. Given text like yummy, though, the function should return 0.

Either before or after you implement count in um.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_um.py, three or more functions that collectively test your implementation of count thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_um.py
