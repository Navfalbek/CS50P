"""
In a file called working.py, implement a function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding 
str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each.
Assume that these times are representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
9 AM to 5 PM

Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats or if either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.).
But do not assume that someoneâ€™s hours will start ante meridiem and end post meridiem; someone might work late and even long hours (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).

Either before or after you implement convert in working.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_working.py, three or more functions that collectively test your implementation of convert thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_working.py
