Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed,
or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input,
replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).

x = str(input("Type something: "))

print(x.replace(" ", "..."))
