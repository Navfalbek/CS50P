"""
In the United States, it’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost.


Well, we’ve written most of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to implement two functions:

⚫dollars_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as $##.##, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the leading $, 
    and return the amount as a float. For instance, given $50.00 as input, it should return 50.0.
⚫percent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as ##%, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the trailing %, 
    and return the percentage as a float. For instance, given 15% as input, it should return 0.15.
    
    
Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.

def main():
    dollars = dollars_to_float(input("How much was the meal? "))
    percent = percent_to_float(input("What percentage would you like to tip? "))
    tip = dollars * percent
    print(f"Leave ${tip:.2f}")


def dollars_to_float(d):
    # TODO
    #d.translate("$", f"{tip:.1f}")
    d = d.replace('$', '')
    return float(d)



def percent_to_float(p):
    # TODO
    p = p.replace('%', '')
    p = float(p)
    p = p / 100
    return p
