"""
Because emoji aren’t quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support “codes,”
whereby you can type, for instance, :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to 👍. Some programs additionally support aliases,
whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, :thumbsup:, which will also be automatically converted to 👍.

See carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that str,
converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

import emoji

emojize = input("Input: ")

emojize = emoji.emojize(emojize, language = "alias")

print(f"Output: {emojize}")
